<h3> This repository contains Machine Learning algorithms solving classification and regression use cases.</h3>

**1. A straightforward Linear Regression and K-Means algorithm has been done.** <br>
**2. A Naive Bayes algorithm example is also attached.** <br>
**3. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) study has been done from scratch.** <br>
**4 .A Random Forest example is also attached which is fairly simple to understand.**
